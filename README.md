# HelloWorld

Basic HelloWorld app.

Using LinuxMint 20, Atom Editor, Clickable UT etc to create some test apps for PinePhone Community Edition (2gb, PostmarketOS) now running UBports from the eMMC.

This will hopefully serve as a template for some utility/helper app/webapps for installing on the pinephone.
