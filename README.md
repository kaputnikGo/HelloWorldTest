# HelloWorld

Basic HelloWorld app.

Currently testing some things with HTML 5 and mainly audio.

Using LinuxMint 20, Atom Editor, Clickable UT etc to create some test apps for PinePhone Community Edition (2gb, PostmarketOS) now running UBports from the eMMC.

This will hopefully serve as a template for some utility/helper app/webapps for installing on the pinephone.

Releases are not for release but simply a clumsy way of installing .click file on the device via www instead of using adb

**VERSION**
1.0.6

- test mic access via p5js
- stuck at mic perms for app not working on device
